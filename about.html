                <p>Hey y'all, I’m Jesse. I've always been obsessed with music.</p>
                <p>Growing up in Waco, Texas, I played many instruments in church and school, and spent a lot of time learning Beatles songs. I took jazz guitar lessons for many years, and started my own rock band with my best friends. I attended the University of North Texas School of Music where I studied jazz and classical guitar, composition, and west African drumming.</p>
                <p>Now based in Seattle, I’ve written and produced hundreds of original songs for myself and others.</p>
                <p>My newest project, an album of original beats entitled  “Our Fodder” will be out in early 2023.</p>
